This repository contains a Python code example showcasing a common error in average calculations:  handling empty lists and lists containing non-numeric data. The `bug.py` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected and robust solution.  The error arises from not checking for empty lists or ensuring all list elements are numbers. The solution implements appropriate error handling and type checking to prevent this.
